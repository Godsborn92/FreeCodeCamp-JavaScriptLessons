# FreeCodeCamp-JavaScriptLessons
All JavaScript lessons from FreeCodeCamp in one JS file for reference-- In Progress

This is a JavaScript library reference from FreeCodeCamp. I created this file to track my progress through the 
FreeCodeCampCamp "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification". All Code examples below are from FreeCodeCamp to an extent. 
Comments show you what each Code snipit should produce. This file is currently in progress. 
At the end of my progression I may divide this file into segments to showcase each part of the JavaScript track on FreeCodeCamp. 
Shoutout to FreeCodeCamp on the awesome curriculum they provide and tools to jump start you on your journey to becoming a developer. 
Never stop learning and only use this tool as reference for the freeCodeCamp Curriculum as you progress.
